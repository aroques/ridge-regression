# Ridge Regression

Linear regression with regularization, with the regularization
parameter estimated from cross-validation.   

Function y = f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> + 10 to create a random sample (x<sub>j</sub>, y<sub>j</sub>) (training data) of size 12 (that is, j = 1 to 12), by uniform random sampling of x in -2 <= x <= 10.
